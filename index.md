# Hi, I'm Aniketh Girish

<div class="columns" markdown="1">

<div class="intro" markdown="1">

I am a Ph.D. student at IMDEA Networks Institute in Madrid, Spain, advised by Dr. Narseo Vallina-Rodriguez since 2020. My research falls at the intersection of (1) hybrid black-box testing, (2) empirical analysis of covert privacy risks in smart home and mobile ecosystems, and (3) regulatory compliance. I have published in top peer-reviewed venues (e.g., PETS, IMC, USENIX Security), and Q1 journals (IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering). I got the Best Poster Award at the TMA'22 Ph.D. school for my novel approach to IoT testing.

During my Ph.D., I was a visiting researcher at Northeastern University’s Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute (USA), advised by Prof. David Choffnes. Prior to that, I held research positions at the Rochester Institute of Technology (USA) and IIJ Innovation Institute (Japan). I was selected twice for Google Summer of Code, contributing to KDE and GNU Linux, and spent a summer at Ben-Gurion University (Israel) exploring applications of machine learning in cybersecurity.

<!-- <p style="color:red;"><i>From January 2020 onwards, I'm actively looking for Research Associate/Assitant/Internship position to exploring the general areas of networking, measurements, internet protocols and it's security extensions. <b>Email me</b> if you find an overlap of interests!</i></p> -->

<!-- I'm a final year PhD student in [Internet Analytics group](http://people.networks.imdea.org/~narseo_vallina/research.html) at the IMDEA Networks Institute and Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Madrid, Spain advised by [Dr. Narseo Vallina-Rodriguez](https://networks.imdea.org/team/imdea-networks-team/people/narseo-vallina-rodriguez/). I empirically measure the privacy and security risks of smart home and mobile ecosystem with a particular focus on consumer data protection and regulatory compliance. -->

<!-- Prior to joining IMDEA, I was a Remote Research Intern at Rochester Institute of Technology, USA collaborating with [Prof. Tijay](https://taejoong.github.io) and also a Research Associate Intern at the IIJ Innovation Institute (IIJ-II), collaborating with the amazing [Dr. Hajime](https://www.iij-ii.co.jp/members/tazaki.html). My work was focused on Email and DNS Security extensions, and Process-based Isolation with Linux Unikernels. -->

<!-- I'm a Final year bachelor student at [Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham](https://www.amrita.edu/), working on Internet protocols, security and privacy. My research interests lie in the intersection of systems and networks in the broadest sense with a particular focus on QoE, security, privacy, measurement and deployment of Internet protocols. -->

<!-- During my bachelor, I spend most of my time in [amFOSS](https://amfoss.in) advised by [Vipin P](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vipin-pavithran?originalSubdomain=in). amFOSS, a student-run community where like-minded people gather together to learn, solve and have tonnes of fun working on computer science problems and on exciting projects.  -->

My research has influenced industry practices, regulatory bodies, and policy makers at scale. My work revealed covert tracking techniques in modern smart devices, prompting action from major companies—including Apple, Google, Philips, TP-Link, and over 20 other IoT vendors—to strengthen privacy protections across their ecosystems. For instance, Philips redesigned its identifier scheme to prevent long-term device tracking. Google removed dozens of privacy-invasive apps and SDKs from the Play Store, awarded me two bug bounties—one for exposing covert local network scans, and another for revealing canvas fingerprinting via embedded WebViews—and introduced a dedicated local network permission in Android 16 as a direct result of my work.

My research has also informed enforcement policies at leading regulatory authorities such as the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS), the Spanish Data Protection Agency (AEPD), and French Data Protection Agency (CNIL), helping shape discussions around consent, tracking, and platform accountability. My work has also received international media coverage, including in Wired, CBC News, and El País.


<!-- I have been a Google Summer of Code student twice with KDE in 2017 and GNU Linux in 2018. As a Google summer of code project in 2018, I implemented DNS over HTTPS into GNU Wget2 resolvers. Being an open-source fanatic, My bachelor thesis which comprises of a QoE study to see if QUIC-enabled video yields to perceivable differences or not. Hence, to bring perceivable differences in streaming with QUIC, introducing a custom version of QUIC which reduces HoL blocking and significantly more. All this into VLC, nevertheless! Moreover, I'm working on an implementation of Record Layer separation in gnuTLS to serve as QUIC TLS API. -->

<!-- I have been lucky to collaborate with awesome researchers around the globe. [Tijay](https://taejoong.github.io), [Hajime](https://www.iij-ii.co.jp/members/tazaki.html) being the few of them. Thankyou for being the wonderful mentors :) -->
